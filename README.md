# Golang Backend Server

This repository contains a Golang backend server designed to work alongside a frontend, a database, and a microservice. It's primarily built using the Gin framework, and the backend handles request validation, passing it to a microservice, and interacts with the database as required.

## Features

- Validaion, processing requests from the frontend, sending replies.
- Interaction with a microservice.
- Read/Write operations with a database.
- JWT tokens for authorization.

## Tech Stack

- **Golang**: The primary programming language used.
- **Gin**: A web framework used for building the API.
- **jmoiron/sqlx**: For database interaction.
- **lib/pq**: A pure Go Postgres driver for Go's database/sql package.


## Architecture

1. General API Level: Has 3 specific APIs. This level is responsible for validating HTTP requests, setting the response's status code, and transferring it to services.
2. Models: Define the structure of incoming and outgoing data.
3. Services: Where the business logic begins. This includes interactions with the microservice, database operations, etc.
